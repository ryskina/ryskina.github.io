I recently finished my postdoc at [Ev Fedorenko's lab](https://evlab.mit.edu/) at the [McGovern Institute for Brain Research](https://mcgovern.mit.edu/) at [MIT](https://mit.edu/). My research studies long-tail phenomena in language using methodologies from natural language processing, machine learning, linguistics, and cognitive neuroscience.

I completed my PhD in [Language and Information Technologies](http://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/), where I was co-advised by [Matt Gormley](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mgormley/), [Ed Hovy](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~hovy/), and [Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick](http://icebergnlp.github.io/).
Before that, I recieved my BSc and MSc degrees from the [Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology](https://mipt.ru/english/) and [Skoltech](http://www.skoltech.ru/en/). I had also spent time at [MIT InfoLab](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/infolab/) (2015) and [DiDi Labs](https://www.didiglobal.com/science/ailabs) (2020).

Outside of research, I am a core organizer at [Queer in AI](https://www.queerinai.com/) ðŸŒˆ 

I am currently based in Toronto, Canada ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦
